# philosophers
# Description
In this project, it was learned the basics of threading a process. It was learned how to make threads and was discovered the mutex. 
This project contains The Dining Philosopher Problem but a littile bit modified: 
Program can have any number of philosophers uder 200, also philosophers can sleep in this program.
# Game rules
• The philosophers must never be starving. 
• Every philosopher needs to eat. 
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other. 
• Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die. 
• Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping. 
• When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking. 
• The simulation stops when a philosopher dies. 
• One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher. 
• Each philosopher should be a thread.
# Launching
Run make to compile the project. 
Then run ./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep where all time must be in ms.

number_of_philosophers: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
time_to_die: is time each philosopher must ate
time_to_eat: is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
time_to_sleep: is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping.
Or run ./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat where 
number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat is the number each philosopher should eat and then simulation stops.
